# Complex Search AI project

This project is based on search algorithms used to solve a search-based problem using a maze GUI in order to 
illustrate the solution basis of the algorithms implemented.

### Algorithms:

* **Hill climbing:** In numerical analysis, hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to 
the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, 
then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a 
better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can 
be found.


* **Hill climbing with random restarts:** Random-restart hill-climbing conducts a series of hill-climbing searches from 
randomly generated initial states, running each until it halts or makes no discernible progress.


### Constraints:

* The code used for rendering the animation and data structures that holds the GUI for the Maze were coded by Dr. Works,
which is a CS associate professor in Florida State University.
